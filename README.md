Here's a simplified E/R diagram for the Note-Taking Application:

- **Entities:**

    3. Category
    4. Tag
    5. Attachment
    6. Notebook
    7. Trash
    8. Sharing
    9. Permission

**Relationships:**

1. User creates Note (One-to-Many)
    - User (1) ------< Note (Many)
2. User organizes Note into Category (Many-to-Many)
    - User (Many) ------< Category_Note >------ (Many) Category
3. User assigns Tag to Note (Many-to-Many)
    - User (Many) ------< Tag_Note >------ (Many) Tag
4. Note contains Attachment (One-to-Many)
    - Note (1) ------< Attachment (Many)
5. User organizes Note into Notebook (Many-to-Many)
    - User (Many) ------< Notebook_Note >------ (Many) Notebook
6. User deletes Note to Trash (One-to-Many)
    - User (1) ------< Trash (Many) ------< Note (Many)
7. User shares Note with other User (Many-to-Many)
